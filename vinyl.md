# Vinyl

These are the albums I would like to own on vinyl. This collection is currently a bit larger than my CD collection which is cool but it makes these slightly less of a priority.

| Artist      | Album       |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| The Demigs  | Yardling    |
| The Demigs  | Cities Can Wait |
| Peach Pit   | Being So Normal |
| Peach Pit   | You and Your Friends |
| Portugal. The Man | American Ghetto |
| Portugal. The Man | The Satanic Satanist|

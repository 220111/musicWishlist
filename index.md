# About

This site is just a bunch of tables full of albums that I would like to own at some point.

There is no specific order to the lists other than what I happen to think of first. 

I am impartial to which format I prefer. The vinyl is more collectable in terms of owning the music but the CDs help feed my iPod and digital music collection which is quite small right now.
